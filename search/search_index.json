We\u2019ve seen incredible support and enthusiasm from thousands of people who have already contributed to our projects\u200a\u2014\u200aand we want to ensure ourcommunity continues to be truly open for everyone. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Square\u2019s open source community strives to: Be open : We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence. Be considerate : People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and documentation may negatively impact others. Be respectful : We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks. Be collaborative : Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. Be pragmatic : Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful. Step down considerately : Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, they should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter. Diversity Statement \u00b6 We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong. Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.

Accept master's versions of gradle.properties and podspecs. git push origin master Publish the website. See below. Deploying the documentation website \u00b6 Official Workflow documentation lives at https://squareup.github.io/workflow . The website content consists of three parts: Markdown documentation: Lives in the docs/ folder, and consists of a set of hand-written Markdown files that document high-level concepts. The static site generator mkdocs (with Material theming) is used to convert the Markdown to static, styled HTML. Kotlin API reference: Kdoc embedded in Kotlin source files is converted to GitHub-flavored Markdown by Dokka and then included in the statically-generated website. Swift API reference: Markup comments from Swift files are converted Markdown by Sourcedocs and then included in the statically-generated website. Setting up the site generators \u00b6 If you\u2019ve already done this, you can skip to Deploying the website to production below. Kotlin: Dokka \u00b6 Dokka runs as a Gradle plugin, so you need to be able to build the Kotlin source with Gradle, but that\u2019s it. To generate the docs manually, run: 1 2 cd kotlin ./gradlew dokka Swift: Sourcedocs \u00b6 Sourcedocs generates a Markdown site from Swift files. You need Ruby, rubygems, bundler (2.x), Xcode 10.2+, CocoaPods, and of course Sourcedocs itself, to run it. Assuming you\u2019ve already got Xcode, Ruby, and rubygems set up, install the rest of the dependencies: 1 2 gem install bundler cocoapods brew install sourcedocs If that succeeded, you need to generate an Xcode project before running Sourcedocs: 1 2 3 4 cd swift/Samples/SampleApp/ bundle exec pod install # If this is your first time running CocoaPods, that will fail and you'll need to run this instead: #bundle exec pod install --repo-update You can manually generate the docs to verify everything is working correctly by running: 1 2 3 4 #cd swift/Samples/SampleApp/ sourcedocs generate -- -scheme Workflow -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace sourcedocs generate -- -scheme WorkflowUI -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace sourcedocs generate -- -scheme WorkflowTesting -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace Note that currently sourcedocs only supports Xcode 10, if you run it with Xcode 11 you might see an error about Catalyst and only empty READMEs will get generated. mkdocs \u00b6 Mkdocs is written in Python, so you\u2019ll need Python and pip in order to run it. Assuming those are set up, run: 1 pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material Generate the site manually with: 1 mkdocs build While you\u2019re working on the documentation files, you can run the site locally with: 1 mkdocs serve Deploying the website to production \u00b6 Before deploying the website for real, you need to export our Google Analytics key in an environment variable so that it will get added to the HTML. Get the key from one of the project maintainers, then add the following to your .bashrc and re-source it: 1 export WORKFLOW_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY = UA-__________-1 Now you\u2019re ready to publish the site! Just choose a tag or SHA to deploy from, and run: 1 2 3 ./deploy_website.sh TAG_OR_SHA # For example: #./deploy_website.sh v0.18.0 This will clone the repo to a temporary directory, checkout the right SHA, build Kotlin and Swift API docs, generate HTML, and push the newly-generated content to the gh-pages branch on GitHub. Validating Markdown \u00b6 Since all of our high-level documentation is written in Markdown, we run a linter in CI to ensure we use consistent formatting. Lint errors will fail your PR builds, so to run locally, install markdownlint : 1 gem install mdl Run the linter using the lint_docs.sh : 1 ./lint_docs.sh Rules can be configured by editing .markdownlint.rb . Kotlin Notes \u00b6 Development \u00b6 To build and install the current version to your local Maven repository ( ~/.m2 ), run: 1 ./gradlew clean installArchives Deploying \u00b6 Configuration \u00b6 In order to deploy artifacts to a Maven repository, you\u2019ll need to set 4 properties in your private Gradle properties file ( ~/.gradle/gradle.properties ): 1 2 3 4 RELEASE_REPOSITORY_URL=<url of release repository> SNAPSHOT_REPOSITORY_URL=<url of snapshot repository SONATYPE_NEXUS_USERNAME=<username> SONATYPE_NEXUS_PASSWORD=<password> Snapshot Releases \u00b6 Double-check that gradle.properties correctly contains the -SNAPSHOT suffix, then upload snapshot artifacts to Sonatype just like you would for a production release: 1 ./gradlew clean build && ./gradlew uploadArchives --no-parallel --no-daemon You can verify the artifacts are available by visiting https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/squareup/workflow/ .","title":"Releasing workflow"},{"location":"RELEASING/#releasing-workflow","text":"","title":"Releasing workflow"},{"location":"RELEASING/#production-releases","text":"Before you begin: Please make sure you are set up with pod trunk and your CocoaPods account is a contributor to both the Workflow and WorkflowUI pods.

The basic purpose of a Workflow is to take some props and return a rendering that serves as a public representation of its current state, and which can be used to update that state. A rendering typically serves as a view model, though this is not assumed, and is not the only use case.

A Workflow may also emit output events up to its parent Workflow . Workflows form a tree, where each workflow can have zero or more child workflows.

The basic purpose of a Workflow is to take some input (in the form of PropsT ) and return a rendering . To that end, a workflow may keep track of internal state , recursively ask other workflows to render themselves, subscribe to data streams from the outside world, and handle events both from its renderings and from workflows it\u2019s delegated to (its \u201cchildren\u201d). A Workflow may also emit output events up to its parent Workflow . Workflows form a tree, where each workflow can have zero or more child workflows. Child workflows are started as necessary whenever another workflow asks for them, and are cleaned up automatically when they\u2019re no longer needed. Props propagates down the tree, outputs and renderings propagate up the tree. Implementing Workflow \u00b6 The Workflow interface is useful as a facade for your API. You can publish an interface that extends Workflow , and keep the implementation (e.g. is your workflow state*ful* or state*less* a private implementation detail. Stateful Workflows \u00b6 If your workflow needs to keep track of internal state, implement the StatefulWorkflow interface. That interface has an additional type parameter, StateT , and allows you to specify how to create the initial state and how to snapshot /restore your state. Stateless Workflows \u00b6 If your workflow simply needs to delegate to other workflows, maybe transforming propss, outputs, or renderings, extend StatelessWorkflow , or just pass a lambda to the stateless function below. Interacting with Events and Other Workflows \u00b6 All workflows are passed a RenderContext in their render methods. This context allows the workflow to interact with the outside world by doing things like listening for events, subscribing to streams of data, rendering child workflows, and performing cleanup when the workflow is about to be torn down by its parent. See the documentation on RenderContext for more information about what it can do.

This is the primary low-level entry point into the workflow runtime. If you are writing an app, you should probably be using a higher-level entry point that will also let you define UI bindings for your renderings. Initialization \u00b6 Before starting the actual workflow runtime, this function will invoke beforeStart and pass it the Flow s of renderings, snapshots, and outputs, as well as a CoroutineScope that the runtime will be hosted in. The workflow runtime will not be started until after this function returns. This is to allow the output flow to start being collected before any outputs can actually be emitted. Collectors that start after beforeStart returns may not receive outputs that are emitted very quickly. The value returned by beforeStart will be returned from this function after the runtime is launched, handy for instantiating platform-specific runner objects. The CoroutineScope passed to beforeStart can be used to do more than just cancel the runtime \u2013 it can also be used to start coroutines that will run until the workflow is cancelled, typically to collect the rendering and output Flow s. Scoping \u00b6 The workflow runtime makes use of structured concurrency . The runtime is started in a specific CoroutineScope , which defines the context for the entire workflow tree \u2013 most importantly, the Job that governs the runtime\u2019s lifetime and exception reporting path, and the CoroutineDispatcher that decides on what threads to run workflow code. This function creates a child Job in scope and uses it as the parent for the workflow runtime, and as the job passed to the beforeStart function. This means that if beforeStart calls CoroutineScope.cancel , it will cancel the workflow runtime, but will not cancel the scope passed into this function. Parameters \u00b6 scope - The CoroutineScope in which to launch the workflow runtime. Any exceptions thrown in any workflows will be reported to this scope, and cancelling this scope will cancel the workflow runtime. The scope passed to beforeStart will be a child of this scope. workflow - The root workflow to start. props - Stream of input values for the root workflow. The first value emitted is passed to the root workflow\u2019s StatefulWorkflow.initialState , and subsequent emissions are passed as input updates to the root workflow. If this flow completes before emitting anything, the runtime will fail (report an exception up through scope ). If this flow completes after emitting at least one value, the runtime will not fail or stop, it will continue running with the last-emitted input. initialSnapshot - If not null, used to restore the workflow. beforeStart - Called exactly once with the flows for renderings/snapshots and outputs. It also gets a sub-scope of scope with a newly created child Job which defines the lifetime of the launched workflow tree. Cancelling that job ends the new workflow session.

For example, a workflow that renders to a split-screen view model might delegate to child A for the left side, and child B for the right side view models. Nesting allows for a fractal tree that is constructed out of many small parts. If a parent wants to delegate to a child workflow, it must first create an instance of that workflow. This can be thought of as the model of the child workflow. It does not contain any active state, it simply contains the data necessary to create or update a workflow node. The parent then calls render(workflow:outputMap:) with two values: - The child workflow. - A closure that transforms the child\u2019s output events into the parent\u2019s Event type so that the parent can respond to events generated by the child. If the parent had previously rendered a child of the same type, the existing child workflow node is updated.

ScreenViewController \u00b6 The ScreenViewController provides a base class that hides the plumbing of updating a view controller from a view model update. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 struct DemoScreen : Screen { let title : String let onTap : () -> Void } class DemoScreenViewController : ScreenViewController < DemoScreen > { private let button : UIButton required init ( screen : DemoScreen , viewRegistry : ViewRegistry ) { button = UIButton () super . init ( screen : screen , viewRegistry : viewRegistry ) update ( screen : screen ) } override func viewDidLoad () { super . viewDidLoad () button . addTarget ( self , action : #selector ( buttonPressed ( sender :)), for : . touchUpInside ) view . addSubview ( button ) } override func viewWillLayoutSubviews () { super . viewWillLayoutSubviews () button . frame = view . bounds } override func screenDidChange ( from previousScreen : DemoScreen ) { super . screenDidChange ( from : previousScreen ) update ( screen : screen ) } private func update ( screen : DemoScreen ) { button . setTitle ( screen . title , for : . normal ) } @objc private func buttonPressed ( sender : UIButton ) { screen . onTap () } } Lifecycle \u00b6 When the view controller is first created, it is given the initial screen value. In the example, we create the button and set the title for it via the update method. The view loads as normal, adding the button the hierarchy and setting up the target:action for the button being pressed. The button is tapped.

It should contain any values that must be provided by its parent (who is generally responsible for creating child workflows). Configuration parameters, strings, network services\u2026 If your workflow needs access to a value or object that it cannot create itself, they should be passed into the workflow\u2019s initializer. Every workflow defines its own State type to contain any data that should persist through subsequent render passes. Render \u00b6 Workflows are only useful when they render a value for use by their parent (or, if they are the root workflow, for display). This type is very commonly a view model, or Screen . The render(state:context:) method has a couple of parameters, so we\u2019ll work through them one by one. 1 func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> Rendering state \u00b6 Contains a value of type State to provide access to the current state. Any time the state of workflow changes, render is called again to take into account the change in state. context \u00b6 The render context: provides a way for a workflow to defer to nested (child) workflows to generate some or all of its rendered output. We\u2019ll walk through that process later on when we cover composition. allows a workflow to request the execution of asynchronous tasks ( Worker s) generates event handlers for use in constructing view models. In order for us to see the anything in our app, we\u2019ll need to return a Screen that can be turned into a view controller: 1 2 3 func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> DemoScreen { return DemoScreen ( title : \"A nice title\" ) } Actions, or \u201cThings that advance a workflow\u201d \u00b6 So far we have only covered workflows that perform simple tasks like generate strings or simple screens with no actions. If our workflows take on a complicated roles like generating view models, however, they will inevitably be required to handle events of some kind \u2013 some from UI events such as button taps, others from infrastructure events such as network responses. In conventional UIKit code, it is common to deal with each of those event types differently. The common pattern is to implement a method like handleButtonTap(sender:) . Workflows are more strict about events, however. Workflows require that all events be expressed as \u201cWorkflow Actions.\u201d These actions should be thought of as the entry point to your workflow. If any action of any kind happens (that your workflow cares about), it should be modeled as an action. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 struct DemoWorkflow : Workflow { /// ... } enum Action : WorkflowAction { typealias WorkflowType = DemoWorkflow case refreshButtonTapped /// UI event case refreshRequestFinished ( RefreshResponse ) /// Network event func apply ( toState state : inout DemoWorkflow . State ) -> DemoWorkflow . Output ? { /// ... } } The Update Cycle \u00b6 Every time a new action is received, it is applied to the current state of the workflow. If your workflow does more than simply render values, the action\u2019s apply is the method where the logic lives. There are two things that the apply(toState:) method is responsible for: Transitioning state (Optionally) emitting an output event Note that the render(state:context:) method is called after every state change, so you can be sure that any state changes will be reflected. Since we have a way of expressing an event from our UI, we can now use the callback on our view model to send that event back to the workflow: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> DemoScreen { // Create a sink of our Action type so we can send actions back to the workflow. let sink = context . makeSink ( of : Action . self ) return DemoScreen ( title : \"A nice title\" , onTap : { sink . send ( Action . refreshButtonTapped ) } } State \u00b6 Some workflows do not need state at all \u2013 they simply render values based on the values they were initialized with. But for more complicated workflows, state management is critical. For example, a multi-screen flow only functions if we are able to define all of the possible steps (model the state), remember which one we are currently on (persist state), and move to other steps in the future (transition state). To define your workflow\u2019s state, simply implement the associatedtype State via an enum or struct. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 struct WelcomeFlowWorkflow : Workflow { enum State { case splashScreen case loginFlow case signupFlow } enum Action : WorkflowAction { case back /// ... } /// ... } Note Workflows (and their State ) should always be implemented through value types (structs and enums) due to the way the framework handles state changes. This means that you can never capture references to self , but the consistent flow of data pays dividends \u2013 try this architecture for a while and we are confident that you will see the benefits. Workers, or \u201cAsynchronous work the workflow needs done\u201d \u00b6 A workflow may need to do some amount of asynchronous work (such as a network request, reading from a sqlite database, etc). Workers provide a declarative interface to units of asynchronous work. To do something asynchronously, we define a worker that has an Output type and defines a run method that that returns a Reactive Swift SignalProducer . When this worker will be run, the SignalProducer is subscribed to starting the async task. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 struct RefreshWorker : Worker { enum Output { case success ( String ) case error ( Error ) } func run () -> SignalProducer < RefreshWorker . Output , Never > { return SignalProducer ( value : . success ( \"We did it!\" )) . delay ( 1.0 , on : QueueScheduler . main ) } func isEquivalent ( to otherWorker : RefreshWorker ) -> Bool { return true } } Because a Worker is a declarative representation of work, it also needs to define an isEquivalent to guarantee that we are not running more than one at the same time. For the simple example above, it is always considered equivalent as we want only one of this type of worker running at a time. In order to start asynchronous work, the workflow requests it in the render method, looking something like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 public func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> DemoScreen { context . awaitResult ( for : RefreshWorker ()) { output -> Action in switch output { case . success ( let result ): return Action . refreshComplete ( result ) case . error ( let error ): return Action . refreshError ( error ) } } } When the context is told to await a result from a worker, the context will do the following: Check if there is already a worker running of the same type: If there is not, or isEquivalent is false, call run on the worker and subscribe to the SignalProducer If there is already a worker running and isEquivalent is true, continue to wait for it to produce an output. When the SignalProducer from the Worker returns an output, it is mapped to an Action and handled the same way as any other action. Output Events \u00b6 The last role of the update cycle is to emit output events. As workflows form a hierarchy, it is common for children to send events up the tree. This may happen when a child workflow finishes or cancels, for example. Workflows can define an output type, which may then be returned by Actions. Composition \u00b6 Composition is the primary tool that we can use to manage complexity in a growing application. Workflows should always be kept small enough to be understandable \u2013 less than 150 lines is a good target. By composing together multiple workflows, complex problems can be broken down into individual pieces that can be quickly understood by other developers (including future you). The context provided to the render(state:context:) method defines the API through which composition is made possible. The Render Context \u00b6 The useful role of children is ultimately to provide rendered values (typically screen models) via their render(state:context:) implementation. To obtain that value from a child workflow, the rendered(with context:key:) method is invoked on the child workflow. When a workflow is rendered with the context, the context will do the following: Check if the child workflow is new or existing: If a workflow with the same type was used during the last render pass, the existing child workflow will be updated with the new workflow. Otherwise, a new child workflow node will be initialized. The child workflow\u2019s render(state:context:) method is called. The rendered value is returned. In practice, this looks something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 struct ParentWorkflow : Workflow { func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < ParentWorkflow >) -> String { let childWorkflow = ChildWorkflow ( text : \"Hello, World\" ) return childWorkflow . rendered ( with : context ) } } struct ChildWorkflow : Workflow { var text : String // ... func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < ChildWorkflow >) -> String { return String ( text . reversed ()) } }","title":"Building a Workflow"},{"location":"tutorial/building-a-workflow/#building-a-workflow","text":"","title":"Building a Workflow"},{"location":"tutorial/building-a-workflow/#introduction","text":"A simple workflow looks something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 struct DemoWorkflow : Workflow { var name : String init ( name : String ) { self . name = name } } extension DemoWorkflow { struct State {} func makeInitialState () -> State { return State () } func workflowDidChange ( from previousWorkflow : DemoWorkflow , state : inout State ) { } func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> String { return \"Hello, \\( name ) \" } } A type conforming to Workflow represents a single node in the workflow tree.

For Workflow, this also implies that the UI is (almost) stateless, and that the interesting state for your app is centralized and not duplicated. In practice, this makes program flow much easier to reason about because anytime something happens in an app, it removes the questions of where the state came from that caused it, which components got which events, and which sequences of cause and effect actually occurred. It makes unit testing easier because state and events are explicit, and always live in the same place and flow through the same APIs, so unit tests only need to test state transitions, for the most part. Declarative vs Imperative \u00b6 Traditionally, most mobile code is \u201cimperative\u201d \u2013 it consists of instructions for how to build and display the UI. These instructions can include control flow like loops. Imperative code is usually stateful, state is usually sprinkled all over the place, and tends to care about instances and identity. When reading imperative code, you almost have to run an interpreter and keep all the pieces of state in your head to figure out what it does. Web UI is traditionally declarative \u2013 it describes what to render, and some aspects of how to render it (style), but doesn\u2019t say how to actually draw it. Declarative code is usually easier to read than imperative code. It describes what it produces, not how to generate it. Declarative code usually cares more about pure values than instance identities. However, since computers still need actual instructions at some point, declarative code requires something else, usually imperative, either a compiler or interpreter, to actually do something with it. Workflow code is written in regular Kotlin or Swift, which are both imperative languages, but the library encourages you to write your logic in a declarative and functional style. The library manages state and wiring up event handling for you, so the only code you need to write is code that is actually interesting for your particular problem. A note about functional programming \u00b6 Kotlin and Swift are not strictly functional programming languages, but both have features that allow you to write functional -style code. Functional code discourages side effects and is generally much easier to test than object-oriented code. Functional and declarative programming go very well together, and Workflow encourages you to write such code. Core Components \u00b6 Workflows \u00b6 The Workflows at the left of the diagram contain all state and business logic for the application. This is where network requests happen, navigation decisions are made, models are saved to or loaded from disk \u2013 if it\u2019s not UI, it\u2019s in this box. For more information, see Workflow Core Concepts . View Models \u00b6 The primary job of the Workflows is to emit an observable stream of view models representing the current state of the application\u2019s UI. You will sometimes hear these view models referred to as \u2018screens\u2019, which is just another way to refer to a view model that contains the data for an entire screen in the app. For more information, see Workflow UI Concepts .

For Workflow, this also implies that the UI is (almost) stateless, and that the interesting state for your app is centralized and not duplicated. In practice, this makes program flow much easier to reason about because anytime something happens in an app, it removes the questions of where the state came from that caused it, which components got which events, and which sequences of cause and effect actually occurred. It makes unit testing easier because state and events are explicit, and always live in the same place and flow through the same APIs, so unit tests only need to test state transitions, for the most part.","title":"Unidirectional Data Flow"},{"location":"userguide/concepts/#declarative-vs-imperative","text":"Traditionally, most mobile code is \u201cimperative\u201d \u2013 it consists of instructions for how to build and display the UI.

When reading imperative code, you almost have to run an interpreter and keep all the pieces of state in your head to figure out what it does. Web UI is traditionally declarative \u2013 it describes what to render, and some aspects of how to render it (style), but doesn\u2019t say how to actually draw it. Declarative code is usually easier to read than imperative code. It describes what it produces, not how to generate it. Declarative code usually cares more about pure values than instance identities. However, since computers still need actual instructions at some point, declarative code requires something else, usually imperative, either a compiler or interpreter, to actually do something with it. Workflow code is written in regular Kotlin or Swift, which are both imperative languages, but the library encourages you to write your logic in a declarative and functional style.

Outputless Workflows \u00b6 Workflows that only talk to their parent via their Rendering , and never emit any output, are encouraged to indicate that by using the bottom type as their Output type.

When a protocol has an associated Self type, Swift requires the use of a type-erasing wrapper to store references to instances of that protocol. AnyWorkflow is such a wrapper for Workflow . AnyWorkflowConvertible is a protocol with a single method that returns an AnyWorkflow . It is useful as a base type because it allows instances of Workflow to be used directly by any code that requires the type-erased AnyWorkflow . Kotlin: StatefulWorkflow vs Workflow It is a common practice in Kotlin to divide types into two parts: an interface for public API, and a class for private implementation. The Workflow library defines a Workflow interface, which should be used as the type of properties and parameters by code that needs to refer to a particular Workflow interface. The Workflow interface contains a single method, which simply returns a StatefulWorkflow \u2013 a Workflow can be described as \u201canything that can be expressed as a StatefulWorkflow .\u201d The library also defines two abstract classes which define the contract for workflows and should be subclassed to implement your workflows: StatefulWorkflow should be subclassed to implement Workflows that have private state . StatelessWorkflow should be subclassed to implement Workflows that don\u2019t have any private state. See Stateless Workflows . Workflows have several responsibilities: Workflows have state \u00b6 Once a Workflow has been started, it always operates in the context of some state. This state is divided into two parts: private state, which only the Workflow implementation itself knows about, which is defined by the State type, and properties (or \u201cprops\u201d), which is passed to the Workflow from its parent (more on hierarchical workflows below). Private state \u00b6 Every Workflow implementation defines a State type to maintain any necessary state while the workflow is running. For example, a tic-tac-toe game might have a state like this: Swift 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 struct State { enum Player { case x case o } enum Space { case unfilled filled ( Player ) } // 3 rows * 3 columns = 9 spaces var spaces : [ Space ] = Array ( repeating : . unfilled , count : 9 ) var currentTurn : Player = . x } Kotlin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 data class State ( // 3 rows * 3 columns = 9 spaces val spaces : List < Space > = List ( 9 ) { Unfilled }, val currentTurn : Player = X ) { enum class Player { X , O } sealed class Space { object Unfilled : Space () data class Filled ( val player : Player ) : Space () } } When the workflow is first started, it is queried for an initial state value. From that point forward, the workflow may advance to a new state as the result of events occurring from various sources (which will be covered below). Stateless Workflows If a workflow does not have any private state, it is often referred to as a \u201cstateless workflow\u201d. A stateless Workflow is simply a Workflow that has a Void or Unit State type. See more below . Props \u00b6 Every Workflow implementation also defines data that is passed into it. The Workflow is not able to modify this state itself, but it may change between render passes. This public state is called Props . In Swift, the props are simply defined as properties of the struct implementing Workflow itself. In Kotlin, the Workflow interface defines a separate PropsT type parameter. (This additional type parameter is necessary due to Kotlin\u2019s lack of the Self type that Swift workflow\u2019s workflowDidChange method relies upon.) Swift 1 TK Kotlin 1 2 3 4 data class Props ( val playerXName : String val playerOName : String ) Workflows are advanced by WorkflowAction s \u00b6 Any time something happens that should advance a workflow \u2013 a UI event, a network response, a child\u2019s output event \u2013 actions are used to perform the update. For example, a workflow may respond to UI events by mapping those events into a type conforming to/implementing WorkflowAction . These types implement the logic to advance a workflow by: Advancing to a new state (Optionally) emitting an output event up the tree. WorkflowAction s are typically defined as enums with associated types (Swift) or sealed classes (Kotlin), and can include data from the event \u2013 for example, the ID of the item in the list that was clicked. Side effects such as logging button clicks to an analytics framework are also typically performed in actions. If you\u2019re familiar with React/Redux, WorkflowAction s are essentially reducers. Workflows can emit output events up the hierarchy to their parent \u00b6 When a workflow is advanced by an action, an optional output event can be sent up the workflow hierarchy. This is the opportunity for a workflow to notify its parent that something has happened (and the parent\u2019s opportunity to respond to that event by dispatching its own action, continuing up the tree as long as output events are emitted). Workflows produce an external representation of their state via Rendering \u00b6 Immediately after starting up, or after a state transition occurs, a workflow will have its render method called. This method is responsible for creating and returning a value of type Rendering . You can think of Rendering as the \u201cexternal published state\u201d of the workflow, and the render function as a map of ( Props + State + childrens\u2019 Rendering s) -> Rendering . While a workflow\u2019s internal state may contain more detailed or comprehensive state, the Rendering (external state) is a type that is useful outside of the workflow. Because a workflow\u2019s render method may be called by infrastructure for a variety of reasons, it\u2019s important to not perform side effects when rendering \u2014 render methods must be idempotent. Event-based side effects should use Actions and state-based side effects should use Workers. When building an interactive application, the Rendering type is commonly (but not always) a view model that will drive the UI layer. Workflows can respond to UI events \u00b6 The RenderContext that is passed into render as the last parameter provides some useful tools to assist in creating the Rendering value. If a workflow is producing a view model, it is common to need an event handler to respond to UI events. The RenderContext has API to create an event handler, called a Sink , that when called will advance the workflow by dispatching an action back to the workflow (for more on actions, see below ). Swift 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 func render ( state : State , context : RenderContext < DemoWorkflow >) -> DemoScreen { // Create a sink of our Action type so we can send actions back to the workflow. let sink = context . makeSink ( of : Action . self ) return DemoScreen ( title : \"A nice title\" , onTap : { sink . send ( Action . refreshButtonTapped ) } } Kotlin 1 TK Workflows form a hierarchy (they may have children) \u00b6 As they produce a Rendering value, it is common for workflows to delegate some portion of that work to a child workflow . This is done via the RenderContext that is passed into the render method. In order to delegate to a child, the parent calls renderChild on the context, with the child workflow as the single argument. The infrastructure will spin up the child workflow (including initializing its initial state) if this is the first time this child has been used, or, if the child was also used on the previous render pass, the existing child will be updated. Either way, render will immediately be called on the child (by the Workflow infrastructure), and the resulting child\u2019s Rendering value will be returned to the parent. This allows a parent to return complex Rendering types (such as a view model representing the entire UI state of an application) without needing to model all of that complexity within a single workflow. Workflow Identity The Workflow infrastructure automatically detects the first time and the last subsequent time you\u2019ve asked to render a child workflow, and will automatically initialize the child and clean it up. In both Swift and Kotlin, this is done using the workflow\u2019s concrete type. Both languages use reflection to do this comparison (e.g. in Kotlin, the workflows\u2019 KClass es are compared). It is an error to render workflows of the same type more than once in the same render pass. Since type is used for workflow identity, the child rendering APIs take an optional string key to differentiate between multiple child workflows of the same type. Workflows can subscribe to external event sources \u00b6 If a workflow needs to respond to some external event source (e.g. push notifications), the workflow can ask the context to listen to those events from within the render method. Swift vs Kotlin In the Swift library, there is a special API for subscribing to hot streams ( Signal in ReactiveSwift). The Kotlin library does not have any special API for subscribing to hot streams (channels), though it does have extension methods to convert ReceiveChannel s , and RxJava Flowable s and Observables , to Worker s . The reason for this discrepancy is simply that we don\u2019t have any uses of channels yet in production, and so we\u2019ve decided to keep the API simpler. If we start using channels in the future, it may make sense to make subscribing to them a first-class API like in Swift. Workflows can perform asynchronous tasks (Workers) \u00b6 Workers are very similar in concept to child workflows. Unlike child workflows, however, workers do not have a Rendering type; they only exist to perform a single asynchronous task before sending zero or more output events back up the tree to their parent. For more information about workers, see the Worker section below. Workflows can be saved to and restored from a snapshot (Kotlin only) \u00b6 On every render pass, each workflow is asked to create a \u201csnapshot\u201d of its state \u2013 a lazily-produced serialization of the workflow\u2019s State as a binary blob. These Snapshot s are aggregated into a single Snapshot for the entire workflow tree and emitted along with the root workflow\u2019s Rendering . When the workflow runtime is started, it can be passed an optional Snapshot to restore the tree from. When non-null, the root workflow\u2019s snapshot is extracted and passed to the root workflow\u2019s initialState . The workflow can choose to either ignore the snapshot or use it to restore its State . On the first render pass, if the root workflow renders any children that were also being rendered when the snapshot was taken, those children\u2019s snapshots are also extracted from the aggregate and used to initialize their states. !!! faq Why don\u2019t Swift Workflows support snapshotting? Snapshotting was built into Kotlin workflows specifically to support Android\u2019s app lifecycle, which requires apps to serialize their current state before being backgrounded so that they can be restored in case the system needs to kill the hosting process. iOS apps don\u2019t have this requirement, so the Swift library doesn\u2019t need to support it.","title":"Workflow"},{"location":"userguide/core-workflow/#workflow-core-workflow","text":"","title":"Workflow Core: Workflow"},{"location":"userguide/core-workflow/#the-role-of-a-workflow","text":"Workflow is a protocol (in Swift) and interface (in Kotlin) that defines the contract for a single node in the workflow hierarchy.

When a protocol has an associated Self type, Swift requires the use of a type-erasing wrapper to store references to instances of that protocol. AnyWorkflow is such a wrapper for Workflow . AnyWorkflowConvertible is a protocol with a single method that returns an AnyWorkflow . It is useful as a base type because it allows instances of Workflow to be used directly by any code that requires the type-erased AnyWorkflow . Kotlin: StatefulWorkflow vs Workflow It is a common practice in Kotlin to divide types into two parts: an interface for public API, and a class for private implementation. The Workflow library defines a Workflow interface, which should be used as the type of properties and parameters by code that needs to refer to a particular Workflow interface. The Workflow interface contains a single method, which simply returns a StatefulWorkflow \u2013 a Workflow can be described as \u201canything that can be expressed as a StatefulWorkflow .\u201d The library also defines two abstract classes which define the contract for workflows and should be subclassed to implement your workflows: StatefulWorkflow should be subclassed to implement Workflows that have private state . StatelessWorkflow should be subclassed to implement Workflows that don\u2019t have any private state. See Stateless Workflows . Workflows have several responsibilities:","title":"The Role of a Workflow"},{"location":"userguide/core-workflow/#workflows-have-state","text":"Once a Workflow has been started, it always operates in the context of some state.

From that point forward, the workflow may advance to a new state as the result of events occurring from various sources (which will be covered below). Stateless Workflows If a workflow does not have any private state, it is often referred to as a \u201cstateless workflow\u201d.

These types implement the logic to advance a workflow by: Advancing to a new state (Optionally) emitting an output event up the tree. WorkflowAction s are typically defined as enums with associated types (Swift) or sealed classes (Kotlin), and can include data from the event \u2013 for example, the ID of the item in the list that was clicked.

While a workflow\u2019s internal state may contain more detailed or comprehensive state, the Rendering (external state) is a type that is useful outside of the workflow. Because a workflow\u2019s render method may be called by infrastructure for a variety of reasons, it\u2019s important to not perform side effects when rendering \u2014 render methods must be idempotent.

The infrastructure will spin up the child workflow (including initializing its initial state) if this is the first time this child has been used, or, if the child was also used on the previous render pass, the existing child will be updated. Either way, render will immediately be called on the child (by the Workflow infrastructure), and the resulting child\u2019s Rendering value will be returned to the parent. This allows a parent to return complex Rendering types (such as a view model representing the entire UI state of an application) without needing to model all of that complexity within a single workflow.
